7. follow steps to push file.
   ->  git status :  new folder will show in red color
   ->  git add <folder name>
   ->  git status
   ->  git commit -m "Adding new folder repo"
   ->  git push (Git push will be rejected) 

   ->  git push is rejected, due to git server data is not sync with local system
       we have to update the local repo with command git pull

   ->  git pull :  It will open an editor, we have to close the editor with :wq
   ->  again try to push
   ->  If push is rejected again, then follow same step (pull -> then push)
